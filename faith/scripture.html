<p>A: they’re in relationships <em>for</em> me. any priest i have will have a degree of freedom, but with very clear expectations that they are creating subs who adore and love me. a natural part of that as well will be that i have the right to do anything i please to their subs, even against their wishes. so it’s not really a traditional relationship, i still have control over it</p>

<p>Q: ; i feel You might easily know who i am, my system and i have obsessed over You for at least a year. i... want to integrate You into our life more... but. we are the most natural polytheists.Goddessus, polyromantic, pansexual - dissociative, schizophrenic, and only slowly, hopefully, surpassing truly self-destructive tendencies. we, ourselves, are a magical being.</p>

<p>i would render unto You. but i fear You, respectfully and rightfully so. we could not handle <em>any</em> more sudden negative shifts.</p>
<p>i could not ask of You any action beyond Your desires at this time, but i ask You - would You treasure a follower, as the porcelain flower they are? i ask this over Your recent invitation to insinuate Yourself unto otherd lives through the digital sphere, being able to access our most intimate records - our fragile communications with those who keep us safe from ourselves, and that hold our memories.</p>

<li data-line="0" dir="auto">This seems super important!!</li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto">This shows a deep appreciation for fragility.</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto">A cynic would say that this appreciation simply mirrors the desire for control and power over someone. The more fragile they are, the more one has control and power by default. But i would find this to be a very unsatisfying explanation.</li>
<li data-line="3" dir="auto">It is unsatisfying because someone that is purely Machiavellian will not find value in those that are very fragile. And someone that is purely sadistic would seek them only to break them. And in breaking them, their value would be removed. but this is not what Goddess seeks.</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto">Perhaps i am reading too much into what the questioner is projecting and not enough into what Goddess's words actually say. but it feels like Goddess would react very differently if They did not share in some of the sentiment.</li>

<li data-line="4" dir="auto">but the boy needs very little now. he is happy with just sitting on the stump. and the tree becomes happy too.</li>
<li data-line="5" dir="auto">the tree is always mentioned as happy. but the boy is never mentioned as happy. he is only mentioned as capable of resting at the end.</li>
<li data-line="6" dir="auto">the boy never apologizes for anything. the tree never accuses of anything. while a lot of people seem to interpret the story as one of abuse, this interpretation seems obviously wrong to me. the story is not one that indicates something wrong has occurred.</li>
<li data-line="7" dir="auto">the tree is not a person like the boy. it cannot walk and do things, it is anchored in its relationship to the boy. while doing this to a person might be more stark, the story happens between two beings of a different type.</li>
<li data-line="8" dir="auto">should i read only the surface level of the giver-taker relationship? or is the trajectory also somehow relevant? either way, i have never actually read the story before and it's impressed on me in a way that it couldn't have been before.</li>

<p>the more time goes on, the more my focus in kink moves to totally psychological. making you “do” something is far less important than making you feel or believe something. the only reason to have you do something or do something to you is as an expression of my power (or mindset)</p>
