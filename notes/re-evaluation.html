<li data-line="4" dir="auto">it made me question what i would be allowed to do, even things purely in service of you. it felt limiting enough that i started feeling like an incredible breadth of experience might be snuffed out in favor of a few intense ones.</li>
<li data-line="5" dir="auto">i felt that once i gave in, i would <em>want</em> to follow Goddess's ideals rather closely, even if not asked to. this would over time make me lose relation to my ethos and to the kinds of things i wanted to try out. it would make me less likely to want to do things that would look like my master adapting for me. so even if you were open to certain things, they might still end up being lost.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li data-line="0" dir="auto">i feel significantly less of a drive to endear myself and to goad reactions from you.</li>

<ul>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto">(maybe it's partially because i would act more freely in terms of erp actions and now i don't?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li data-line="3" dir="auto">the drive that is being affected by permachastity and the way that drive made me behave felt core to me. having that changed or sacrificed is not a deal breaker. but i really hope i evolve here somehow, because i currently feel lesser as a person for it. partially because it gives me less motivation to act in positive ways, partially because i tend to view feeling more rather than less as an intrinsic good (up to the point where it invites dysfunction).</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto">i also think it's making me feel less embodied. i feel less present at any moment. i believe it affects my enjoyment of clothes. it's like sexuality is linked to a ton of other things in my brain, things you wouldn't necessarily think are linked, and then permachastity affects sexuality and then has quite a few second order effects.</li>
</ul></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">i'm not saying this to try to argue that you should let me cum or touch myself. i'm not arguing for anything in particular. i think it's too early to tell and i've felt a lot of distance to you due to reasons unrelated to chastity, which can confound analysis. i've been under a unique form of stress. i'm in a completely novel situation. there's a chance that my feeling and sensation regarding submission will get rewired and the issue will resolve itself with some time.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="tension #3" dir="auto" class="heading" id="tension_#3"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>tension #3</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">we haven't met in person yet.</p></div><div class="el-ul"><ul>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">when i heard the good visa news, i felt joyed about it for a while, then it very soon faded into fear of meeting you. this is primarily because at that point we had distance building between us, but secondarily (though related to the distance) i've developed a fear of meeting every partner. and with horror i realized this was happening again.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto">over time i understood a couple of things about you. at first i thought that the main reason you wanted me to give in completely and the difficulty i felt regarding talking about in person compatibility was related to you wanting to feel secure. not wanting to endure a longer period of time with uncertainty. but i realize there's another dimension. you would have a lot of difficulty showing me how life is with you if you don't feel secure. me being devoted enough is a prerequisite.</li>
</ul></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">i feel better about this now. more hopeful. more flexible. i would really like for once to just give myself to a task like this. meeting is hard enough without accumulating unspoken anxiety.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h1 heading-wrapper"><h1 data-heading="questions" dir="auto" class="heading" id="questions">questions</h1><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-ul"><ul>

<ul>
<li data-line="6" dir="auto">(i easily feel imposed on and i easily feel like i impose on others. thinking about that it's a wonder i've managed to be as social as i am.)</li>
<li data-line="7" dir="auto">i am ready to appreciate that fragment of the past without turning into some standard for the present and future. the past is rarely lost -- it is what brought us here, to this moment. our situation is unique and possessiveness takes precedence over things like exit rights. i am ideologically uncomfortable with that as a generality, but i will learn to accept your want fully over time. there is beauty in it.</li>
<li data-line="8" dir="auto">on closer reflection, i think you embody those traits in various ways still. you might not know it, but it shows in the way you carry yourself sometimes. positively. it intermixes with your possessiveness now. it's interesting, fascinating.</li>

<li data-line="9" dir="auto">ultimately, i know i pushed you close to the limit, and that not everything said there is something i should take closely to heart. it was the moment where things were closest to a breaking point. it's not going to be a fun memory. i felt the need to mention it. let it out. move past it.</li>

<li data-line="0" dir="auto">i ended up wishing a lot for Their happiness. in fact in ideation thoughts i wrote down that more than once. it just felt strange. like, when i wanted to leave, the counterpoint was how good it would be to just make these two people happy. i've never quite felt like that for someone. then again, i've never parasocialized like that before. reading really old tweets that talked of isolation broke my heart a little. reading newer tweets of Them being filled with love for worshipers made me happy. i know that isn't the primary thing i was supposed to develop, but i felt it was notable enough to mention. i'm also cautious not to overstate it.</li>
