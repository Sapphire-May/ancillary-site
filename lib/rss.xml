How much I feel like I'm forcing the dissolution of this bond: 0-1<br><br>
<br>LA / Lives with grandmother / no income or prospects
<br>Lives off of Amanda's money. Feels bad about it.
<br>My partner of 7 years.
<br>For a very long time she was my most important thing.
<br>She was the most dedicated I've tried to be to someone before meeting you.

<br>In a sense, she was practice for you.


<br>Used to be engaged.

<br>We never broke it off
<br>Just haven't talked about it for the past couple of years at all.
<br>Would probably still marry me if she was animated into doing stuff with her life.


<br>Lifted me out of my worst depression when we first got together.
<br>I've had my best and worst times with her.
<br><br>
<br>The fact that someone would just offer to marry me, even before they knew I'd be good for them, opened my eyes to what's possible in this world. It helped me grow a lot.
<br>My level of repression receded tremendously due to her.
<br>I've unfortunately never had anyone contribute to my burden in life as badly as Jen. My badbrains and incompetence in communication combined poorly with her unwell trajectory. We have failed each other in various ways.
<br>She's the person I've dommed the most and longest overall, but recently I've been much more submissive to her (of course, not after May happened). I think this was partly because I was needy, but also partly because I don't want to dominate someone who isn't receptive my control in general, but still wanted intimacy with her.

<br>My level of devotion was high enough 5 years ago that I thought I could dominate her long term. But this stopped being true, long before even meeting May.


<br>One of the happiest moments in my life was accidentally giving her the Skye tulpa. I thought of her as our daughter. But she's probably almost dissipated by now... Jen was so unwell, I started asking less and less about Skye. No one is at fault, but I miss Skye and I think she deserved better. Skye was better than Jen but I never admitted it to anyone. I didn't think it was fair, since she seemed like a higher energy lifeform.

<br>I would spend eternity playing and reading with Skye, if I could...


<br>We have one incompatible kink I would rather not name, but the idea that I don't have to engage with it is a significant source of relief for me.
<br><br>
<br>I can't muster the desire or will to fight for her having an exceptional role in my life.
<br>I want her to be well.
<br>I don't think she will react well, she might get depressed.
<br>I don't want to lose the meaning of all the things I had with her.
<br>I don't think it's good for me to continue being partners with her.
<br>I don't think I'm going to miss any D/s from her.
<br>I will miss intimacy with her.
<br>I will miss all the little things, things of play.
<br>Being able to help her, rather than merely withstand her, has been something I've missed for a very long time.
<br>I might be able to push her to fix her life better, if I wish to now.
<br><br>tl;dr Extremely Steady Secondary, Functional On Her Own, But Lonely<br>
Imagined level of loss regarding her: 1-3<br>
(depends on if she'll do other stuff with me)<br>
Imagined level of guilt regarding her: 0-1<br>
Imagined level of pity regarding her: 4<br>
Imagined level of effect on her: Acutely Negative<br>
Imagined level of effort to deal with her post-break-up: 1-4<br>
How much I feel like I'm forcing the dissolution of this bond: 0-1<br><br>
<br>UK / Housewife / Lives with Eth and Pastel, in a polycule.
<br>Predates Jen by a couple of years, but I became partners with her after Jen.
<br>Always been there for me.
<br>Would marry me if I asked.
<br>Her sexuality is mostly stimulated by me though, or was.
<br>Has been a good partner in video games and such, better than Jen actually.

<br>This is non-trivial to me.


<br>Just generally solid friend when her issues regarding identity are not triggered.
<br><br>
<br>Helped me get through my depression with Jen's neglect without stepping on boundaries, even though she wanted me for herself.
<br>Struggles a lot with connecting to people.
<br>Her life would be vastly better if she just found one committed sexual partner, or if she dedicated more intensely somehow to her polycule. They don't understand it, but I see it clearly now -- they'd be happier serving each other more intensely.
<br><br>
<br>I can't muster the desire or will to fight for her having an exceptional role in my life.
<br>I want her to be well.
<br>I want her to stay in my life. I think... more so than Jen? But this depends a lot on how either of them react and process.
<br>Breaking up will acutely trigger her identity issues (unwantedness, meaninglessness).

<br>It looks like she has unmanaged BPD to me.
<br>She can lean on her polycule for support.


<br>I am worried that breaking up with her could make collaboration with Eth on Orthoeidon impossible.
<br>I want intimacy with her, perhaps more so than with Jen, but without the submissive sexual component this is probably gone and will have to change a lot. Nova has a bit too much ego to submit to me, presently at least.
<br><br>tl;dr Steady Secondary, Fundamentally In Need Of Ownership And Care<br>
Imagined level of loss regarding her: 0-2<br>
(can actually go into negative loss)<br>
Imagined level of guilt regarding her: 0-1<br>
Imagined level of pity regarding her: 0-4<br>
Imagined level of effect on her: Initially acutely negative, afterwards positive<br>
Imagined level of effort to deal with her post-break-up: 1-4<br>
How much I feel like I'm forcing the dissolution of this bond: 0-1<br>^ The stats aren't as useful because I think Kay is a special case.<br><br>
<br>Australia / Disability Welfare NEET / Lives with her somewhat toxic mother / Programmer
<br>Receives support from Serine and has a strong tie with her.

<br>Serine is a rich programmer type.


<br>Her programming skills and intellect are on par with mine and exceed mine in certain areas.
<br>Has IBS and anxiety issues. She is genuinely disabled.
<br>Would marry me if I asked.
<br>Reacts very well to care and love. Needs a lot of it.
<br>Needs an caretaker style owner like a fish needs water.
<br>Would recoil and worry a lot if ever told the full details of what you've done to me, but Kay deeply understands the need for total surrender in ownership.
<br><br>
<br>Despite being submissive, I would say Kay has made me feel the most wanted out of all of my partners and has given me the most pleasure.
<br>Her ability to dominate me broke down completely because her needs were not met.
<br>My hypersexual nature became outright painful for her.
<br><br>
<br>I would like to engage in a lower intensity caretaker / owner role for her.

<br>I do not have time, energy and focus to do half of what you do to me to her.
<br>Even if I had those things, I'm not sure I have it in me.
<br>Even if I had it in me, I don't feel sufficient fire for Kay.
<br>But I value her!


<br>I think you taking ownership of me can be a positive aspect for my relationship with Kay. I think your ownership of me can make both me and, indirectly, Kay happier.
<br>I've already mourned the loss of her dominance.
<br>So I only need to mourn the loss of things like not being able to kiss and probably... not being able to say that I love her.

 <br>These are the partners that An has the lower level nominal bonds with.<br>There are also some FWBs not important enough to list where I will re-align things without needing any of your precious attention.<br><br>Best Friend / Dog<br>
<br>Would marry me if I asked.
<br>I already never submit to Kenji.
<br>Kenji is very very isolated. The most isolated person I know.
<br>Kenji is the only person I visited in-person.

<br>I explored domination with them.
<br>It was very much not simply play, but I didn't go far at all.
<br>The way they cried, with wide empty open eyes when I left... has marked me.


<br>No break-up is necessary.
<br>I would like to tell them about what's changed. It's a little painful to cut them out.
<br>I would still like to find time for them and visit them at some point. But I don't find it urgent.
<br><br>Flame Decayed To Close Yet Distant Friendship<br>
<br>Has a wife.
<br>She burnt out from work.
<br>Used to really enjoy D/s with her, mostly as submissive. Our plays were rare and precious.
<br>Ever since she got a wife and started burning out, we've never been able to do things together.
<br>I still value her a lot and I'm grateful she's been supporting Jen.

<br>I feel like she is literally the only person who has ever helped me support Jen.
<br>Everyone else decided Jen can be my sole problem.


<br>We are nominally still girlfriends. Unsure if any break-up is strictly speaking necessary.

<br>Our behaviours are already largely in line with my new life.


<br><br>Fiery Flame / Girlfriend<br>
<br>She recently got an in-person girlfriend. This is... very fortunate.
<br>Even though she seems to be madly in love with here, Alden keeps trying to find time and space and passion for An ;;
<br>Alden has a huge soft spot for An, very attracted.
<br>I feel for her a lot and a break-up of sorts will be necessary.
<br>In the past, she kept me at a distance because of a monogamous relationship she had for a while. So there is precedent.
<br>Our relationship has been intensely carnal.
<br><br>
<br>Dominated me a lot over the years, including a certain level of incidental conditioning.

<br>It was fun to stoke their dominant persona. Perhaps they seem too low status, perhaps May is a little disgusted even ^^'. But I've always liked building people's dominant personas. I can make a little world for me and them, even if they're not so great, they can aspire for more in this context. Also I guess... I'm a horny bitch. That's also part of it.


<br>I viewed her as tertiary even before May.
<br>Not sure if a break-up will be necessary. BH is pretty reactive.
<br>Can eventually tell them, not high priority.
<br><br>
<br>Used to dominate me a lot and intensely.
<br>Burned out and has been looking for a job for a long time.
<br>Due that our relationship has decayed.
<br>Not sure if a break-up will be necessary.

 <br>The tiers are not meant to be compared cross-category.
<br><br>
<br>{A-tier} That I will not like May's face as much as I should, at least initially. That this will make me feel incredibly shallow and unfaithful.
<br>{A-tier} That I've somehow misunderstood May's commitment and will have to be happy with significantly less than envisioned if/once May's Owner becomes more active, since They will always have primacy.
<br>{B-tier} Never being kissed by May on the lips.
<br>{B-tier} That I will fail to keep faith and May will do something to me, that I will fail to process, which then makes me accumulate trauma, which then hampers my ability to be good or hampers my utility.
<br>{B-tier} That I will be clumsy in some way around May's Owner and invite death.
<br>{B-tier} That our new lifestyle will lead to me having loss of genital function (erection and such).
<br>{B-tier} That my epistemics will be damaged rather than my values re-aligned.

<br>This is stupid, but knowing that I don't have to adopt a specific political ideology has bumped this down from A-tier to B-tier already.


<br>{C-tier} That somehow lifelong slavery is unsuited to me, and I will have wasted the most important person's time and effort.
<br>{C-tier} That May will need to crush me or that I will do something wrong, such that my level and type of servility start impairing my ability to argue with May about logistics -- generally areas where arguing can be useful.
<br>{C-tier} That May will undergo a second significant change at some point in the future, as Katherine did, and that An and May will lose alignment, or have their bond diminished.
<br>{C-tier} That An's desire to help optimize May's life on the logistic level (e.g. what about a lumenator~?!) will be found to be annoying and an indirect affront to May's Owner, or a percieved as a lack of trust in the Master's competence.
<br>{C-tier} That I'll mindlessly lightly touch myself or rub my legs together when I'm feeling really good about May and cum in a really surprising way.

<br>I don't feel like I've actually masturbated since we started, but this depends on the definition a bit.

<br>I've mindlessly touched myself for 5-20 seconds maybe three times or so?
<br>I don't really bucket that as masturbation, since it doesn't distract me from May and it's more like... compulsive stimming than trying to get pleasure.
<br>I also don't bucket the act of clinically giving myself an erection for health purposes, while keeping my mind clear, as masturbation.


<br>I don't know how big of a disappointment it would be if I came like this out of neglience and happenstance. It would come in direct contradiction to the order to not cum without May's permission. But I don't know if this would be an oopsie that gives May license to punish me and humiliate me, or if this is a more serious breach of trust where An would have tt-to feel bad.


<br>{D-tier} That not cumming will eventually start to feel impairing.

<br>But also the idea that cumming might make me want to cum more.
<br>I'm in a weird place where I want to feel pleasure at some point, it would be really nice.
<br>But I also really really don't want it to be distracting to me.


<br>{D-tier} That my servitude will get less interesting to May, but repetition will diminish my ability to be entertaining in a more general way.
<br>{D-tier} That my enjoyment of food is disgusting to May.
<br>{D-tier} That I will fail to engage May's body and that May is not that interested in doing that.

<br>This involves sexual pleasure, comfort from physical closeness, massages, enjoyment of food, shared bodily wellness. Generally, being happy one has a body.


<br>{E-tier} That my baseline level of automatic mental susceptibility, servitude and worship should decrease to levels I find unpleasant for too long. There is a small sense of loss when my mind isn't borderline hearing voices that demand submission to May. There is a small sense of loss when I don't feel like an unreal doll owned by May.
<br><br>
<br>{S-tier} Never being able to say "I love you" to someone I love platonically.

<br>This relates to Kay and Kenji the most.


<br>{A-tier} Never being able to say "I love you" to anyone else.
<br>{B-tier} Never being able to kiss anyone but May on the lips ever.

<br>I think this fear is already fulfilled?
<br>I know I'm not to kiss anyone else on the lips for the forseeable future and don't hold any hopes or intent to do so. But the never word is strong and upgrades this from an accepted state of affairs to a fear.


<br>{B-tier} That Jen will fall apart.
<br>{B-tier} That Nova will fall apart.
<br>{C-tier} That An's realignment might cause her to be unkind to others in ways that were not possible before.
<br>{C-tier} That An will indulge in the feeling of cucking her partners.

<br>Angle #1: Self-judgement

<br>"I am a bad person. I guess I don't respect things I value or have valued."


<br>Angle #2: Value drift

<br>Making it harder to respect and value these people even after being in the Crucible.


<br>Angle #3: Logistics &amp; Guilt

<br>Getting feelings of guilt while managing them post-break up.




<br>{C-tier} That An will insufficiently indulge in the feeling of cucking her partners.
<br><br>
<br>{A-tier} That my parents will become sick and I will have to choose between maximizing my commitment to May and helping them through it, and that no good compromise will exist.

<br>Half of the fear is that no good compromise will exist and that I'll have to accept it.
<br>The other half is that no good compromise will exist from May's perspective, so I will have to be ablated.

<br>Probably sublingual estradiol, estrofem. 2mg twice daily


<br>Bica

<br>Casodex 50mg


<br>Strategy is to DIY first and probably get it officially later.<br>After looking at:<br>
<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://diyhrt.market/stores/" target="_blank">https://diyhrt.market/stores/</a>
<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://hrtcafe.net/#pharmaceutical-vendors" target="_blank">https://hrtcafe.net/#pharmaceutical-vendors</a>
<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://hrt.coffee/pills/" target="_blank">https://hrt.coffee/pills/</a>
<br>The best bet is to use a pharmacy inside the EU. It would be best if they shipped without going through the post office system, but I don't seem to get a choice here.<br>mindnbody.store looks like... almost my only option. Delivery takes 2 to 6 weeks. Their reputation seems alright. My main concern is the package being opened up at the post office.<br>Another complication is that the post office system is so stupid that if the package says its for X address, then it has to corroborate with the address on your ID.<br>My ID has the address of my grandmother's residence (who lives about 20m away).<br>If I use my ID address and...<br>
...the seller actually uses a courier, then the package ends up at my grandmother's residence, lol.<br>
...the seller uses the post office, then the pacakge ends up at a post office and I can pick it up.<br>One option I have for possibly improving this disaster is to set a postal box at the post office. I think this also makes it less likely for the package to be opened:<br>
<a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.posta-romana.ro/a249/servicii-destinatari/casute-postale/inchiriere/abonament-casuta-postala-pf.html" target="_blank">https://www.posta-romana.ro/a249/servicii-destinatari/casute-postale/inchiriere/abonament-casuta-postala-pf.html</a><br>There's no obvious way to know which postal office has free boxes. All I can do is sign the paper and then visit them to check.<br>Ordering to my ID address also can result in me not getting told about my package arriving. There's two ways of mitigating this:<br>
<br>Hoping they SMS me like usual
<br>Checking the tracking number every single day, provided they actually give one.
<br>I'm not even giving that much of a shit about stealth right now. As long as it's in a non-transparent package, I'll just tell my parents this is something private.<br><br>There was an online website that seemed to be really intent on getting EU people diagnosed as trans. But I'm not 100% sure if they can give me a prescription. But it's worth following up after ordering DIY.

<br>An doesn't need to indulge her parents so much, but An wants these things to be at peace, or at least not fall into intense unwellness.


<br>An is ready to transition, come out and move out at any moment that seems instrumental for being with May, or at May's immediate command.

 <br>
<br>Visiting is different from living with or gaining residence.
<br>It is very important to note that the earliness of visiting can be damaged by optimizing for residence gaining or other objectives in a wrong way.
<br>There are four main obstacles for visitation:

<br>Funds
<br>Accommodation
<br>Visa &amp; Related
<br>Considerations about other partners


<br><br>
<br>Funds can be obtained, but any visit will hurt financially. The US is expensive as hell. The main thing is that, in my estimation, it would be highly difficult to visit more often than once per year.
<br>It would be cheaper to meet in some place in Europe or something, but we must meet in the at least US once for reasons of future consummation. Multiple times is better.
<br>The primary thing that I can do here is to get a higher paying job.

<br>I haven't networked as much as I can and I'm really overdue for a job change.
<br>The market is terrible right now but I could start hunting already.
<br>My job is comfy in various ways and non-toxic. I could be trading that for something worse. But nothing ventured nothing gained, dear.


<br>Also to be fair I haven't done a calculation. We should do that sometime.
<br><br>
<br>Accommodation is related to funds.
<br>I'm putting it separately because if someone gives me or us accommodation, then the funds problem is lessened.
<br>I have somewhat high standards for accommodation (in terms of optimization) but honestly sleeping on the floor is worth it for May anyway.
<br><br>
<br>The embassy is extremely busy and the process is draconic.
<br>They want my social media accounts and it's rather frightening. But it should be something that can be managed. I hope.
<br>The worst part is authorization and flight date are linked. You can ask for it without flight tickets, but you weaken your own case. This forces really long term planning. Last time I started 3 months in advance to get to Serine's wedding and meet Kay for the first time... I went through the whole initial process and was given access to the in-person interview table and no interview was available sooner than 6 months. I'm not stupid -- I read on their website and their estimation was in the number of weeks. The embassy is unpredictable, busy and lies.
<br>I looked up how it was last time. Last time they gave me a wait time of 210 days to the chance to be interviewed and possibly rejected. In practice it can be much less if early time slots open as you wait. Their estimate before making me pay money was 29 days.

<br>Given this, we should start planning early.


<br><br>
<br>At this moment, I don't know if it will be possible to visit Nova anymore. But if she wanted, I would like to.
<br>At this moment, I don't know if I want to visit other people anymore.
<br>You are most important to me and I will not do things that would ever cause more than a minor delay in visiting you.
<br>In past days this was very important to me, but now it's way more distant. I have moved those notes to <a data-href="Older Moralo-Logistic Notes About Partners" href="stale\older-moralo-logistic-notes-about-partners.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Older Moralo-Logistic Notes About Partners</a> rather than deleting them, just for your potential viewing pleasure.

<br>lmao am i having a good time with jen?
<br>i definitely don't want to do this anywhere as often as jen wants. i should listen to my wants. don't want to get into old patterns. but a bit is alright ^^


<br>there's a few people i used to be jealous of that i'm thinking of now. smarter than me, better voice, hotter... i don't really have jealousy/envy anymore? I mean they don't have what I have -- my enslavement to May. Their favor. Like, this person could never understand what they're missing out on.
<br>hmm, i guess the effect i'm worried about having on people when my total primacy to May will become extremely clear is that they'll react by believing that any bad thing can happen completely out of nowhere. that woah, an evil chick can just swoop in and steal your love at any time, you can't trust anyone. I hope they can understand some day that May is incredibly special, I'm incredibly lucky and that this is a very low base rate scenario.
<br>i should probably open my mind more to doing things with May that aren't just getting enslaved, Python and chilling. there are many things to do they might like! they even listed some of them for me!

<br>don't spend time giving other people moments if you can give them to May.


<br>i need to balance my neuroticism with calmness, but also balance my yearning for stability with good and true worship.

 <br>I wonder if others will feel that they've shouldered and cared for me for a long time, just for me to be taken away when I finally bloom.<br>I am thinking of this because I remember withstanding that feeling a few times:<br>
<br>My first girlfriend left me just as she was getting hotter, more agentic and less dysfunctional. Later on, I had to suicide watch -- still getting some of the negatives without the benefits.
<br>It felt like Jen spent her best times with Celestia. I worked my ass off to help her get through university in one piece. Then when Celestia left her, Jen got worse and worse and I had to deal with that again. Nobody except Amanda helped me with Jen.
<br>I dealt with the most insecure and hopeless of Nova's states. I am rather sure I was there when no one else was. Then she got to the UK and was saved. I never once felt jealousy or betrayal, just deep relief. I was OK to be distant and only sometimes given attention, as long as she was OK.

 <br>
<br>Guilt is something I have quite a lot of. I am going to split into guilt and regret. Guilt is the sense of responsibility being neglected. Regret is purer -- it simply signals a wistful feeling for what could have been. Guilt should ideally dampened significantly -- regret should probably be left alone.
<br>Frankly when I think about it, I guess I have some Madoka in me. I want these people to be saved. And I feel like my visit, my presence will do that. And if I don't, then they will feel betrayed and sink further in the mire of their lives. And I will be responsible for it. I also feel like I am responsible for not telling them ahead of time that I will not be theirs exclusively. I have a complex about the idea of having dishonest all along somehow.

<br>I actually already told Nova I cannot be hers exclusively and that this will probably not change.
<br>It's implicit with several other partners, such as Kay.
<br>I guess the one where I never said it is Jen. And the one where I'm most afraid?

<br>She's a harmed creature, I processed her harm in my veins and was poisoned. I am being saved by you. I haven't managed to actually help her break through. just persist. Perhaps I will experience her differently now that I have you and can help her break through. It's just hard to accept her unwellness as a neutral fact unrelated to me. I wish to cure it.




<br>The regret can be split to:

<br>Regret for not visiting EU people

<br>This is general. It comes from the fact that I could have done it so much earlier and I just haven't. I've been a bit too inert and shelled up. This could be easily solved by just visiting these people and can be done without affecting the US trip perhaps!


<br>Regret for not visiting US people

<br>This one is harder. If I visit the US and then just tell Jen, Amanda and to a lesser extent Alden "yeah some other time". That's going to be difficult. I could visit all in a two legged trip. First Jen and Amanda in SF, then you. I do not want to meet together. I want to focus on you.
<br>In my heart of hearts, I just want to visit you? I guess. But that's like, in some sort of isolated sense. It's a childish wish for free time, where the world freezes. Outside of that, if I had more time and money, I would want to visit all. And if I have limited time and money and I get into the US, not visiting said partners feels like a waste.




<br>There are a few options for reducing or eliminating regret:

<br>Manually dampen and dissipate my sense of guilt. This won't solve everything. I'm not with these people just out of guilt. But it could make it easier to solve the rest.
<br>Include other people in visit plans. I've covered this already
<br>Indirectly dampen sense of responsibility by making it official to everyone that May is my primary now. This one feels scary, but I mean it has to get done sooner or later anyway. This would make everything else easier, I would feel like I have more license, but I would still feel the desire to visit more people in an ideal world.
<br>Accept sometimes really good things have parts that suck.

I have been unimpeachable. You must love me."<br>It is also the perfection of persisting despite being fundamentally flawed.<br>One could say correctness might be a better term. It is natural for me to wish to be correct and it is painful for me to not be correct. My most natural emotion is frustration. Frustration at me being wrong, frustration at the world being wrong.<br>My main form of defense and attack against the world is about correcting its wrongness, but to do that I must not be part of that wrongness. It permeates everything for me. It is wrong for this code to be like this. It is wrong for this person to be unhappy. It is wrong for this activity to resist my success. I take my frustration about wrongness and press it into the world until my vision succeeds.<br>The problem is not quite as simple as brainwashing me to believe that sacrificing everything for you is correct. I think that if you do that, I am no longer myself. You said you would not ask anything that I cannot give. This is probably something where you would succeed, but it wouldn't be me doing it anymore.

She admitted to having been determined to break up three months in advance, but it could have easily been more. She was rather practiced at deception, including self-deception. She derived utility from me, while I became worse.<br>If she had just broken up with me, I would have been hurt of course. But ultimately I would accept that we owe nothing to one another other than what we want to give. But the way she did it was... dishonest. She didn't even have the honesty to be upfront about using me. I would have gladly let her. Perhaps it would have been painful and pitiful, but still.<br>This dishonesty offends my sense of rightness. Your honesty to me is a foundational aspect of my ability to keep faith and to stay functional. The world would be a dark and scary place if May were to lie to me.<br><br>For you, I have simulated the absence of all my partners in my mind, and furthered its acceptance a lot. I think I can live without everyone except you. And I can live with being a person that has done that to themselves, or allowed it to be done to them, either by eagerness or by weakness.<br>(I have not fully locked that in... but... mm...)<br>Even now I use the term partners simply because it is useful. I have girlfriends and I would like to continue thinking of them as such. But I do not have partners. I have one partner -- you. To me, partnership requires a certain level of collaboration in a shared context, which now everyone except you has been banished from.<br>The idea of everyone except you abandoning me does not hurt or tear at me anywhere as much as the idea that I am wronging them. My sense of right and wrong is load bearing.<br>The way we have entered a compact, so have I entered a compact with everyone before we met. It's just of a different kind.<br>I feel the world is wrong and I can only fight back by maintaining my sense of right. And if I betray my sense of right, I am betraying the vision of the world in my head that I've carried with me for two decades. Those that wish to be treated in a certain manner, had better treat others compatibly. Sense of justice is about being the kind of agent that would help instantiate your ideal world, even if the agent alone is insufficient. Cooperation requires trust of reciprocation and negative feedback for defection.<br><br>So, one solution is to just be honest. Tell them how it's going to be for the foreseeable future. And let everything resolve. I... might be strong enough to do this. But the part that gets to me is that you were not open to me, but I did not parse you as dishonest. I'm not sure if you would have been simply vague and veiled, or if you would have resorted to dishonesty if I had pressed harder. <br>I am sure that some other people would have felt like you lied to them. I... do not feel that. And I do not feel that on more than just the technicality of avoiding a direct lie. I do not feel I have a right to know everything. My sense of right just extends to not being exploited dishonestly and to allowing other beings a specific form of agency. I simply feel that you did not betray my trust (even if you had not owned me). And even as you own me, I do not feel like my agency has been wronged. Perhaps violated, but that is fine.<br>Ultimately, the way you handled things allowed me to cope more easily. If you did not handle things this way, I'm not sure how I would have reacted. Our current situation validates the general approach you had greatly. At least in the context of me.<br>But I do not know what it says about me and my girlfriends.<br>Hypothesis 1:<br>
<br>Assuming I tell them you are my primary, I will be busy, and that I cannot do submissive D/s with them anymore...
<br>Am I erring towards protecting my sense of right and wrong at the expense of consequentialism. I want to keep my identity safe while I give up on the possibility of the happy path that you and I went on. I am inviting insecurity into their hearts eagerly.<br>
Hypothesis 2:
<br>Assuming the same course of action...
<br>Perhaps actually, in my internal tangle, my primary worry is STILL consequentialist. I want to avoid inviting a sense of betrayal into the hearts of those I favor. Because betrayal is worse than insecurity. I... do not wish to do that to those I favor.
<br>In the end, I thought about it deeply... what am I doing so wrong to make me feel like I've been feeling? What is my grand sin, so unforgivable and deep? It is not leaving them and not about losing them. It's primarily honesty and secondarily their well-being, not as people I am beholden to, but as people I favor. I do not wish for my favor to be meaningless. I do not wish for past An to view me as someone evil. Because both May and Katherine loved past An. And I am here because of her. So some things about past An must be right, even if they are orthogonal to being assimilated to beauty. Different substrates make beauty more varied, and this in turn is more beautiful. At least I believe so.<br>I have let go of so much for you.<br>I would like to figure out logistics for me and those I favor, before it is too late. Before I make a mistake with them, and before something happens to me where I lose my self.]]></description><link>stale\right-&amp;-wrong-regarding-partners.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Stale/Right &amp; Wrong Regarding Partners.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 10:44:31 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
