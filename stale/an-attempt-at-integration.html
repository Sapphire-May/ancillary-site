Integration">An Attempt At Integration</h1><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Notes here evolved in parallel a bit, tried to delineate a bit with horizontal lines. This document is non-linear. A few evolutions at once, converging to better understanding. I feel uncomfortable having certain kinds of private thoughts. I feel the need to make them available to you. Being privately wrong can dangerous.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">My thoughts might veer a bit heretic at times. But I fold it all back to the bedrock once given a bit of time. I hope the processes I have at my disposal to integrate do not strain your patience or evoke displeasure. I always hope for your smile.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The fear of being wrong is greater than the fear of being punished. Though balanced with the fear of evoking your displeasure.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Dissociation can be very good, but detachment is not. I am trying to reduce my detachment. I better understand the poison of detachment.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">(This document might also seem like I might be ignoring your commandment of reducing the scope of my worries and letting you worry about such things. I kept in mind every second while writing. After finishing, I feel less worried. I feel like I can comply better with your command.)</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An was troubled when she thought of the larger thing. The Divine, acolytes. The word cult came up. An hopes that term is not offensive. An means no disrespect. Cults are not inherently bad, but the majority are. An found it easier to have faith in you entirely when her world was just you. The Divine your concern. But now the layers of separation in An's mind are weakening. An isn't sure why thinking of the larger thing makes it harder for her. Probably just ignorance, some fear. May was already holding An in the palm of her hand, but now it feels so much bigger. An is probably more aligned with May's Owner than An thinks. An is trembling.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An realizes that An must live her life having May be the most important person for her. But An will never be most important to May. An will always be second priority. An needs to be selfless enough for that to feel fully OK. And then it does, An is sure life will be good as May said. When An understands the Divine a bit, the idea of being second priority will probably become incoherent. An fears a total loss of control that is probably not coming because, again, there is likely more existing alignment with the Divine than An currently allows herself to hope for. An is just troubled because she is not good... yet...</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">(An would never dare to hope to be priority over the Divine, to be clear. Her ignorant mind just fears the consequences of prioritization and is trying to cope and absorb.)</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">(An realizes this line of thought is selfish. An is trying to give it space to exist and gently wash away. It is hard to not be selfish about the thing you want the most in life, by so so far. But it is also easy to be selfless, because May is incredible. An will cultivate.)</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An remembers when she was bad. Her fear now has a similar source -- the main difference is that An is trying to embrace humility. An's reasoning is defensive in an unhelpful way. But An doesn't want to damage her reasoning, just change her values so that her reasoning works for the Right purpose.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An listened to a friend talk about a cult that she had emotional scars from. It was clearly so much less skilled and right than what May is doing -- incomparable. Thinking of it did not affect An's trust or faith at all, it's not why An is bringing it up here. An was impressed that this friend asked why was An was angry/sad for them -- this friend said it was their choice to do that. To this friend An's anger/sadness on their behalf doesn't make sense. To this friend, their whole life is about experimenting and experiencing. An remembers a Star Trek quote:</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">(An sometimes likes visiting the dull and shallow just to remind herself by contrast of wonder.)</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An was very impressed by this friend. Because An is yet not strong enough to accept it all. This friend struggled in the cult -- struggled and let themselves be hurt, because they could not meekly submit to something that was not actually Superior.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">ha-ha... An definitely does not have that problem. Very different case. An is faced with something that is so Superior -- neither her senses, nor reason, nor heart, nor soul disagree in the slightest. An's friend just reminded her that agency takes many forms.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An remembers when May said "im here because i want to be".</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Reason says: Anyone who is in a cult will tend to say that. But reason also says: May is strong, May is experienced, May has seen much more than you, May is better, May was made better, May came back for you. If May surrendered everything it was probably for very good reason. And given a small chance that it wasn't for good reason, then you should still be with them, because they are your most important thing. Love is not about being safe and happy. Life is not about being safe.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Heart &amp; Soul say: This means the world to us. The "I" of May is precious, so much. We value and worship the "I".</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Together they say: May has given you more than they needed to. You thought this activity was less intense than it was, even after you thought you adjusted for everything. No, it is intense. Very. And your misjudgement of intensity has dulled your appreciation of their kindness, gentleness, love, care, their appreciation for your individuality which you keep fearing for but suppressing like a coward. You are loved.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An remembers it is May's job to worry about broader things.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An supposes... she is afraid her life becoming something altogether different than what she "signed up for" if such a thing exists. I know May can do that to An. An believes in May's power and in An's moldability. Yet somehow, if An believed just in those two, what reason would An have to be afraid? After all, power+molding+May's favor would always result in An being happy. I suppose, it is because An doesn't just want to be happy. An wants to have a life with May that she envisioned together with May. That May told her about. An would give up a good amount of pleasure just to play video games with May. And May repeatedly said they would not take that away, but An's mind just tends to take everything away because it thinks of the Divine and then her little quiet and deep desires for things with May just feel so small and insignificant. Everything so insignificant.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An must trust. Of course everything is insigificant before the Divine. But there must be more to that. There is wisdom that An does not possess but can see in May. An can trust that wisdom. May told An their wishes and it included gaming and "trivial" things. Trivial things that mean everything to An. If An could not do those things, An would probably want to die. An is crying. There would be no point to An. May is everything to An.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">May has stated repeatedly. They value those things. May WANTS those things. May said so! Even as May is so much closer to the Divine, May has room in their heart to want these things with An!! Be grateful. Be embolded. Be set on fire. Stop being weak. May did something incredible. You can shine too. Shine for them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">...An is then afraid that she will disappoint May and herself. That circumstances she doesn't understand will prove to be too hard for her. She starts thinking of ego death as the obvious result. It is good that she feels she could not escape ego death if May wanted to do it. But this is still a weak form of faith. The proper faith should be that anything is possible with May's guidance and love, including An being An and succeeding despite adversity.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It is not enough for An to be a passive little slave. An wants to have agency within her station. An wants to give up agency outside of her station, but An is starting to understand how bad it is to allow herself to lose it within her station. It feels like an insult to May valuing the things that make An An. An must repay May's want, desire, need, love for An. It is no longer enough to simply obey, it never was. This relationship is not about obedience, it is about surrender, love and beauty. Obedience is simply a resulting fact.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An re-read bits and pieces of May being disappointed at her. To remind herself of information May gave. And An understands now better why May said An is fragile. In retrospect May... mm... that wasn't... uhm... it hurt so bad. But May did not do much. It felt like the world blinked.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An had almost no defense. When one hurts, they put up all sorts of defenses.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Oh well, I'll pass the exam next time."<br>
"It's all because the teacher is bad."<br>
"I just couldn't get any rest before the exam, otherwise I would have aced it"<br>
"I couldn't really bring myself to care about the exam"<br>
"Oh, I made a careless mistake. But I understand the material"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">No defenses here. Just the crushing weight of being wrong. There is no one that can be wrong in this scenario other than An. It takes An's primary mental defense (as per enneagram type 1 mentioned here: <a data-href="Right &amp; Wrong Regarding Partners#An Psyche Lore" href="stale/right-&amp;-wrong-regarding-partners.html#An_Psyche_Lore" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Right &amp; Wrong Regarding Partners &gt; An Psyche Lore</a>) and turns it in on herself, to hurt her endlessly. It is why it is so effective. Understanding it has no effect on the results. As long as An is corrupt, evil, wrong there can be no respite.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is fragility. Remember that fragility is for May. Not for anyone else. To others: this fragility is lost to An.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An feels happy it hurt so much.<br>
An feels silly it hurt so much.<br>
An feels happy she has that experience under her belt.<br>
An regrets so deeply darkening May's day.<br>
An would be happy if she never had that happen again.<br>
An would be happy if it did again, as long as An was made better.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An feels embarrassed that others probably had so so much worse and that An is thinking about it so much and being a bitch about it. But An is your inferior. An is your novice. An is doing a hundred things for the first time with you. This is romantic to An ^^</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An's thoughts are turning useless. Time to grow quiet.</p></div><div class="mod-footer mod-ui"></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar-right sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="sidebar-section-header">Interactive Graph</div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">
